- "src/" contains VSCode extension code, not source for web apps
- Provider examples are canonical reference (docs are outdated)
- UI runs in VSCode webview with restrictions (no localStorage, limited APIs)
- Package.json scripts must be run from specific directories
- Locales in root are for extension, webview-ui/src/i18n for UI
