## 💡 Key Concepts

### Clean Architecture
```
screens → providers → repositories → datasources
   UI      state       business      Firebase/Isar
```

### Riverpod 3.x Pattern
```
final provider = NotifierProvider<MyNotifier, MyState>(
  MyNotifier.new,
);

class MyNotifier extends Notifier<MyState> {
  @override
  MyState build() { ... }
}
```

### Dependency Injection
- Use Riverpod providers for all dependencies
- Never create instances directly in classes
- Use `ref.read()` in providers
- Use `ref.watch()` in UI
