HOW THIS SYSTEM WORKS
================================================================================

1. YOU (Manager/Lead):
   → Read: MVP_STATUS.md or CURRENT_PROGRESS.txt (2-5 min)
   → Decide: What task needs doing?
   → Find: Task card in TASK_CARDS.md
   → Assign: Give agent 3-4 relevant docs

2. AGENT:
   → Read: START_HERE.md (5 min)
   → Read: AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md (20 min)
   → Read: Their task card from TASK_CARDS.md
   → Start: Following the checklist

3. AGENT WORKS:
   → Reference: IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (patterns)
   → Write: Tests first, then code
   → Update: MVP_STATUS.md (daily)
   → Check: AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md (help)

4. YOU TRACK:
   → Check: MVP_STATUS.md (what's done?)
   → Check: CURRENT_PROGRESS.txt (metrics?)
   → Mark: Tasks complete
   → Assign: Next tasks

5. CYCLE REPEATS:
   → Next agent / next task
   → Same system
   → Always up-to-date

================================================================================
QUICK START: ASSIGNING A TASK
================================================================================

Right now, here's what to do:

Step 1 (1 min): Open MVP_STATUS.md
  → Find: Your preferred phase
  → Choose: A task marked [ ] Pending
  → Note: Priority level (🔴 = critical)

Step 2 (5 min): Prepare assignment
  → Open: TASK_CARDS.md
  → Find: Your chosen task card
  → Copy: Entire card to assignment message

Step 3 (2 min): Create files list
  Agent needs these files:
  ✓ START_HERE.md
  ✓ Their TASK_CARD (copied above)
  ✓ AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md (sections: Task Workflow, Code Standards)
  ✓ IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (pattern reference)
  ✓ Relevant phase from plan-flutbookMVP.prompt.md

Step 4 (5 min): Send assignment
  Format:
  Subject: "TASK ASSIGNMENT: Phase X, Task X.Y"
  Body:
    - Brief description of task
    - Why it's important (blocks what?)
    - Time estimate
    - [Paste the TASK_CARD]
    - [List the 5 files they need]
    - Expected completion date

Step 5 (Ongoing): Track progress
  → Agent updates MVP_STATUS.md
  → You check: CURRENT_PROGRESS.txt (daily)
  → When done: Verify acceptance criteria
  → Mark complete: MVP_STATUS.md

RESULT: Task assigned with crystal clear instructions! ✅

================================================================================
DAILY MANAGER WORKFLOW
================================================================================

MORNING (5 min):
  1. Open: CURRENT_PROGRESS.txt
  2. Check: % complete, build issues, days to MVP
  3. Plan: Any blockers to address?
  4. Review: MVP_STATUS.md (if issues seem stuck)

DURING DAY (varies):
  If agent reports blocker:
    1. Check: AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md (is solution there?)
    2. Check: MVP_STATUS.md (are dependencies met?)
    3. Help: Unblock or escalate

  If agent asks question:
    1. Check: DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md (which doc answers this?)
    2. Point: To correct section
    3. Follow up: Did that help?

END OF DAY (5 min):
  1. Check: What got done today?
  2. Update: MVP_STATUS.md (mark tasks complete)
  3. Check: Any new blockers?
  4. Plan: Tomorrow priorities

WEEKLY (30 min):
  1. Review: Full MVP_STATUS.md (weekly progress)
  2. Check: Test coverage & build health
  3. Update: CURRENT_PROGRESS.txt (new metrics)
