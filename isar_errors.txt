Isar DB Configuration and Schema Analysis Report

Based on the analysis of the codebase, the following files have been identified with potential issues regarding the Isar database configuration and schema definitions.

1. File: lib/data/datasources/local/audiobook_local_datasource.dart
   - Problem: Incomplete Schema Registration.
   - Details: The `Isar.open` call in this file only registers the `AudiobookModel` and `PlaybackSessionModel` schemas. The `UserProfileModel` and `LibraryModel` schemas are not included. This will cause runtime errors when trying to access or store `UserProfileModel` or `LibraryModel` objects in the database. All collection schemas must be provided during database initialization.

2. File: lib/data/models/user_profile_model.dart
   - Problem: Schema Defined but Not Registered.
   - Details: This file defines the `UserProfileModel` with an `@collection` annotation, marking it as an Isar collection. However, its schema (`UserProfileModelSchema`) is not passed to the `Isar.open` call, making it unusable with the current Isar instance.

3. File: lib/data/datasources/local/isar_schema.dart
   - Problem: Unused / Dead Code and Schema Duplication.
   - Details: This file contains what appears to be a more complete and centralized set of Isar schema definitions, including `fromDomain`/`toDomain` methods which are missing from the models in `lib/data/models/`. However, this file is not used anywhere in the project. The schemas from this file are not imported or used during Isar initialization. This creates a significant source of confusion and code duplication. The project should have a single source of truth for Isar schemas.

4. Files: lib/data/models/audiobook_model.dart, lib/data/models/playback_session_model.dart
   - Problem: Incomplete Model Implementation.
   - Details: These are the actively used Isar models, but they are less complete than their counterparts in the unused `isar_schema.dart`. They are missing `fromDomain`/`toDomain` conversion methods, which suggests a potential architectural gap between the data layer and the domain layer.
